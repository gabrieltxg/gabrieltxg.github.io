# A rogue planet hypothesis for the Formation of TNO Solar System

Small body populatiton are key to understanding dynamical history of the SS.

- Asteroiod belt (~3% \mearth)
- Jupiter trojans (0.08% \mearth)
- TNO (5% \mearth)
- Oort cloud (1% \mearth)

Recap; 

- Planetary scattering
    - When small body experiences strong encounters with a planet ($a_{p}$) it gets scattered to a smaller semimajor exis with a constant perihelioon.
- Mean Motion Resonance
    - Small bodies locked in MMR with a planet are protected from close encounters
    - face (phase?) protection mechanism
- Secular evolution:
    - When a small body is neither scatteriing nor resonant. Its orbit only precessses due to perturbation from planets.

### Trans Neptunian Space

Kuiper belt objects can be classified in four kinds:

1. Classical (located in 40 <a <48 AU)
2. Resonant ones
3. Scattering ones (Perihelion close to 20 AU)
4. Detached ones (usually dynamical stable).

Hot classicals + resonant + scattering + detached → all belong to bigger hoot population that is thought to obe formed closer to the sun while cold ones were formed *in situ*

### Distant TNO (a > 50 AU)

Difficult to explain. Resonant are couplet with …

Ongoing hypothesis for those bodies (sedinoids, few due to observational bias):

- Should preserve primordial cold classical belt
- There should be a populatoin of resonant and detached TNO
- should account for formation of sednoid objects beyond a> 200 AU.

Theories couldn’t be unified (Grainy Migration, Stellar Flyby, Planet nine). All failed to make something.

Other ideas can account for observed exoplanet distributon:

- since super earths are common in exoplanets, ,it’s reasonable to thin some were formed ini te giant planet region and were scattered →gone to TN region.

Rogue planet can help populate a200 AU uiper belt.

- Huang et al (2022) showed that secular perturbations and evolution could populate resonant and detached population by weak perturbations (some lidov kozai mechanism could decrease eriheliia) to the scattering TNO
- rogue planet was couplet with neptune but was iced from the Solar System.
    - It’s quic existence was enough to reproduce observed dynamical architecture in kuiper belt.

But there’s a need to oconstrain the rogue planet parameters.

**How Is the cold kuiper belt instability timescales estimated → Slide 13 . Where does this estimate come from, analyticaly? Lidov ozai tiimescales?**

### Secular theory! precession timescales?

Migrating Neptune scatters and ejects uiper belt objects but rogue planet (e~0.9) helps to preserve the cold body population for a>200AU. Simulatiions on the order of 200 Myr

For larger integrations (~4Gyr), rogue pllanet model was able to reproduce observed distributions and distinct populations discovered so far.

Biased rogue planet model produces a>50AU detached, distant resonant and scattering populations in agreement with OSSOS detection.
