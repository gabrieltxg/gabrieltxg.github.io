title: Who am I?
---

Hello!

Ignoring all major philosophical implications of such a question, my name is Gabriel, but you can call me Gabs or Gabo. I'm from Brazil and I have been living in Tokyo since April/2023.

I'm a Ph.D candidate at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI) and an Associate Researcher at the Division of Science of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ).

My main research objects are Compact Planetary Systems, which I study from numerical and theoretical point of view, under supervision of Professor Eiichiro Kokubo (NAOJ).

Before coming to the other side of the world, I completed my undergraduate (2012 -- 2018) and Master's Degree (2020 -- 2023) in Astronomy and physics at the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (IAG-USP). During this period I studied chaotic phenomena and more specifically tools for detection of chaotic motion (such as Lyapunov Exponents, Frequency Mappings and Shannon Entropy), when I became the Master of Chaos (or at least M.Sc).

My main scientific interests are celestial mechanics and dynamical astronomy (from small bodies of the solar system to galactic dynamics), planetary formation, evolution and stability and chaotic phenomena in general.

Apart from science, I enjoy reading and listening to all kinds of music (from mongolian throat singing to german punk).

In my free time you can usually see me walking around aimlessly, looking for jazz clubs, throwing random jabs in the streets or just watching as time goes by.

See you!
